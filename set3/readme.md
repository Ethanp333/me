TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week's activities significantly enhanced my understanding on algorithms and the importance of clear code to help with debugging. initially i struggled with activity 3's guessing game, i learned that breaking down the lines of code as well as following the code from activity 1 and 2 helped me overcome this challenge. Additionally, I recognised the necessity of improving areas like the inputs i've learnt this week related to algeritems. In order to stay on top of this, i will look over activity 4 in the near future, helping me better understand the functions. Overall this experience reinforced that incremental learning and constant refinement are crucial for growth in my programming.
