TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week I learnt a range of new coding terms which helped further my knowledge on coding. The activites given where challenging and I was struggling to figure out what was needed to get the task done. Luckily people on my table with more experence with coding where able to help me complete the task. With their help I found out the codes were very similar allowing me to understand what capabilites these fucntions had. In the future I need to keep on learning these terms as I was quick to forget what they did. For example, I need to memerise my values.
