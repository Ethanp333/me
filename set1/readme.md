TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I learnt how coding can be implemented into design through simulations and other aspects creating a cohesive relationship.
I learnt my way around visual studios and what shortcuts I need to write to be able to enter the folder.
During the class I realized how important it is to take a break during class.
I still need to get my head around all the new applications I have.
