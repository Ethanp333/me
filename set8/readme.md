TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week, we had a quiz that really highlighted where I stand with the course content. I realized that I still have a lot of material to review to fully grasp everything and improve my understanding. The quiz was a good wake-up call, showing me the areas where I need to focus more effort. Moving forward, I plan to dedicate more time to revisiting the content to ensure Iâ€™m better prepared for future assessments.
