TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week, I received valuable feedback on my data project, which has been instrumental in refining my approach. My tutors provided useful insights into how I can improve the visual appeal of my graphs, offering specific suggestions that will make the data more engaging and easier to understand. This feedback has encouraged me to revisit my visualizations, ensuring they are not only informative but also aesthetically pleasing. Moving forward, these enhancements will play a crucial role in the overall presentation of my findings.
