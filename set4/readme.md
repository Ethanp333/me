TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week, I deepened my understanding of advanced data handling, API interactions, and file processing. I refined my skills in navigating nested data structures and effectively extracting and manipulating data. Working with APIs enhanced my ability to fetch and process dynamic data. I learned the importance of using appropriate file modes ('r', 'w', 'a', 'r+') and handling platform-specific line endings when reading and writing files. Using the with keyword for file operations ensured proper resource management and error handling. These experiences collectively improved my technical proficiency and problem-solving abilities, preparing me for more sophisticated challenges. I found there to be confusion when completing the last activity of exercise 1, and need to focus on improving my skills in this area for the future.
